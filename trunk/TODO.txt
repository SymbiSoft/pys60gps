Directory size function:

import os
def getDirectorySize(directory):
 dir_size = 0
 for (path, dirs, files) in os.walk(directory):
  for file in files:
   filename = os.path.join(path, file)
   dir_size += os.path.getsize(filename)
 return dir_size

Short term TODOs:

- NO hardcoded screen size, check the size just before update() or change it on resize_callback()?

Track:
- send track data to the server!
+ save new point if heading changes at least xx° 
+ AND the distance to the previous point is at least y meters
+ scrollable map with direction key
- quick keys to show/hide entities (POIs, track, cellids) on the screen

Data:
- ZIP data directory at request

CELLs
- allow cellid data downloading from the server and showing on the track view.
