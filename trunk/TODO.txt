Short term TODOs:

- NO hardcoded screen size, check the size just before update() or change it on resize_callback()?

Track:
- send track data to the server!
- save new point if heading changes at least xx° 
  AND the distance to the previous point is at least y meters
- scrollable map with direction key
- quick keys to show/hide entities (POIs, track, cellids) on the screen

Data:
- ZIP data directory at request

CELLs
- allow cellid data downloading from the server and showing on the track view.
