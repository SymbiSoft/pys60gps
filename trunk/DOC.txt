Pys60gps documentation, very incomplete.

Pys60gps is a "framework" for S60 mobile phones which offers some location based services for 
plugins which can be 
- included in the program package, 
- downloaded from the net or 
- imported from a predefined directory (e.g. E:\Pys60gps)

Datastructures

self.data["gsm_location"] = [] # GSM-cellid history list (location.gsm_location())
# GPS-position
self.pos = {} # Contains always the latest position-record
self.data["position"] = [] # Position history list (positioning.position())
self.pos_estimate = {} # Contains estimated location, calculated from the latest history point
self.data["position_debug"] = [] # latest "max_debugpoints" 
# POIs
self.data["pois_private"] = []
self.data["pois_downloaded"] = []


pos (Main.pos) is a dictionary which may (or may not) contain following keys:
- all keys and values created by positioning.position() call (see the source or pys60-documentation)
- system time
  ["systime"] = time.time()
- zone, easting and northing calculated by LatLongUTMconversion.LLtoUTM()
  ["position"]["z"]
  ["position"]["e"]
  ["position"]["n"]
- GSM-cellid:
  ["gsm"]["cellid"] = location.gsm_location()
  ["gsm"]["signal_bars"] = sysinfo.signal_bars()
  ["gsm"]["signal_dbm"] = sysinfo.signal_dbm()
- Canvas coordinates, related to the center point
  ["x"]
  ["y"]
