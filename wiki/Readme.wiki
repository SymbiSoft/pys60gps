Current functionality
  * show plain gps-data on the screen
  * save position history (track)
  * show saved track on the screen
  * send saved track to the other device via bluetooth
  * add a POI/waypoint
  * show POIs on the screen
  * scan available gsm and wifi (and bluetooth) networks and save results to a log file
  * show current speed and some speed history in a graph (ugly test version)

Future functionality
   * plugin functionality

Currently there is no downloadable installation package,
svn checkout the source instead and put neccessary script files
to your phone's memory card (E:\Python and E:\Python\lib).

Unsigned SIS-package (UID from the test-range) and some 
siginig instructions should be available here soon.
