Pys60gps reads position data gathered from GPS (built-in or bluethooth) and saves it for future use. It works in Nokia's Series60 3rd edition mobile phones (e.g. N95, N82, N85, E70, E90 etc).

It can also show on the "map" user's track and Points Of Interest (POI) downloaded from the Internet. There is work-on-progress to show also vector data on the screen (e.g. OpenStreetMap data).

Pys60gps is a GSM-cellid and WiFi (WLAN) logger. Logged data can be used as a GSM+WiFi based positioning system. OpenNetMap.org is a related project.

Use svn to checkout the source code or bwowse it online (see Source-tab).

Note: you must install properly signed wlantools beforehand if you want to use wlan scanning functionality.
